Last week The Guardian published [an article](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/08/readers-reply-what-is-the-single-most-effective-thing-i-could-do-to-reduce-my-carbon-footprint) where readers were asked for their answers to the question "what is the single most effective thing I could do to reduce my carbon footprint".
The replies are moderated, but they seem to span almost the complete spectrum, from "I'm sure an individual cannot do anything" to "Join Extinction Rebellion protests and get arrested" and "Don't have kids".
These latter two are considered quite extreme for most people (although the even more extreme--and probably more effective--solutions are not even mentioned. They might not have been sent in by readers, or maybe they were deemed unacceptable for publication by the Guardian moderators).

Most people I speak to care about the environment and climate change, and would like to do something to help it go in the right direction.
It's heartening that more and more often I find myself having, or listening in on, discussions on the subject.
What I notice though (and I'm myself to blame as much as anyone else) is that often the discussion goes along the lines "I did X (insert random climate-good thing), and actually my life is better because of it".
I have said many times that I love my electric car, and welcome the charging stops ("it's a good idea anyways to have a break after 2 hours of driving"); however in my heart I fully understand that an internal combustion engine car is more practical when making large trips, or when being in a hurry.
I still 100% support my decision to buy an electric car, but I know that I'm giving up something, in order to do my (little) bit to reduce the climate crisis.

I have grown up in a world that seemed to be focussed on me, and on everything that could make my life better.
For years commercials have told me that I could get things to make my life better/more fun/more beautiful.
I would have to give up a small thing (usually money), but the basis of any good advertisement is the message that the cost is dwarfed by the benefit.

Likewise in school I was taught that this is how (capitalist) economics and (democratic) politics work: every person is just focussed on making their own life better, people vote for the party program that will benefit them most and the politician will try to do those things that lets them get elected because they crave power (or, in a slightly more cynical world view, because they can use their position to enrich themselves).

I think that therefore I feel forced to explain my own actions in this framework (even though this ego-centric world view has been [disproved](https://www.amazon.nl/Humankind-Hopeful-History-Rutger-Bregman/dp/0316418536) [many](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/09/13/164-herbert-gintis-on-game-theory-evolution-and-social-rationality/) [times](https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection?language=en) -- probably there are much better sources out there, these are just from my personal experience); and I feel that in many discussions this approach is taken.
It's fully understandable, but I also think it's fully wrong.

Because as soon as I explain that for me a well-cooked broccoli tastes better than a steak, and therefore I'm very happy to be a vegetarian, it means that my discussion partner is allowed to think the premise of the statement doesn't apply to them (they like a steak better), and therefore neither does the conclusion.
We most likely end up in a discussion about the relative tastiness of vegetables and beef.
And as soon as I convince them that for me the broccoli does taste better, I also convinced them that I didn't give up anything for the climate (so why should they?).

We need to start being honest about these things.
All of us have a certain carbon footprint (which probably is larger that is good for the planet), and we all know of a whole bunch of things we can do to reduce this footprint.
The amount of reduction is the same for everyone (whether you or I give up 1 trans-Atlantic flight (in the same type of plane) a year, the footprint reduction will be the same).
How painful each of these things is however differs from person to person; someone who's afraid of flying and likes domestic holidays may find giving up flights easier than someone with close family on the other side of the globe.










We're used to a world where things get better all the time.
It's been a matra of many generations that each next generation has a better life.
In many cultures, your buying power rises with age (older people tend to earn more, and you slightly get rid of study loans, and start to pay off your house.
There may be moments that your financial situation gets worse (large purchases, a new house, a child), but generally the accepted wisdom in that you get back more in wellness than you lost in wealth.
The whole advertisement industry is focussed on this outlook on life; every single advert promotes an article that will  *undoubtedly* make your life better.

This narative has also been fueled by the industry, especially electronics.
Every couple of years electronics get smaller, cheaper, faster, meaning that the largest and sharpest TVs that only a small while ago were reserved for the super-rich, are now for discount prices in our houses.
A single iPhone 13 Pro device has more computer power than [*the fastest super computer in the world 25 years ago*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCI_Red).
We can now hop on flights to vacation destinations for only tens of euros, where a flight used to be something that you saved up for all year.

Not only did we get used to everything getting better all the time; we also feel it's our right.
I find it hard to imagine a societey that can not even wear face-masks for a couple of months without succombing to huge protests, will ever again be able to make the huge sacrifes necessary in case of huge misforture, disaster or war.

We've known for many years that we, as a species have been living on this planet on a way that is not sustainable.
We're using more resources than the planet can provide, and produce more pollution than the planet can absorb.


Ignore the prob
- Don't trust the information
- Don't deal with the information


Footnote: you cannot really compare the current iPhone to a supercomputer of 25 years ago -- the comparison is just based on FLOPS (Floating point operations per second) for the main processor(s).
Most likely, for pretty much all tasks, the iPhone would run circles around the ASCI Red.

"I actually enjoy that the car forces me to take a break from driving every couple of hours while it charges"
"Heating your house with a heat pump is better on all fronts"
"I have never missed the taste of meat in the past years, and actually feel more healthy today than before"


I've heard these kind of remarks many times over the last couple of years, most often from my own mouth.
As more and more people realise that we should change something in our lives, in order to avoid the climate catastrophy, there is more talk about the things one can do to help.
