Last month I [posted a story](../_posts/2021-07-08-making-fzf-into-a-golang-library-fzf-lib.md) about creating a stand-alone library from [Junegunn Choi's fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
This was the first step in an effort to produce a version of fzf that runs in the browser.
Since then I looked into different methods on how to get fzf-lib to run in the browser; this post is a write-up of what I learned there.
I hope it is useful information for anyone who has a Go library and wants to use it in the browser.
The general lessons should be valid for most non-trivial Go programs.

# Introduction
[The Go programming language is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google][1].
One of the interesting features of Go is the [built-in concurreny][1], which lends itself to writing highly performing scripts.
One of those scripts, one that I use on a daily basis, is [Junegunn Choi's fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), an interactive tool that allows blazing fast searching for text in enourmous lists.
Last month I wrote about [my efforts to build a stand-alone library from the fzf project](../_posts/2021-07-08-making-fzf-into-a-golang-library-fzf-lib.md).

When there is a desire to interface with a commandline tool such as fzf, the "easy" way is to have your program run the fzf commandline program, send it data and read the result.
This works in most other programs, and I have used this successfully in Swift, in Python and in Bash.
If however we want to use fzf's functionality on a web page, we cannot run an external program.
In such a case, we need a version of the fzf library that runs in a web browser.

In order to run a code in a webbrowser, there are (globally speaking) 2 choices.
Since the early 1990s browsers ship with JavaScript, an interpreted language.
Over yime there have been many improvements to JavaScript, both in language features and in running speed.
In the last couple of years another method of running code in the browser has appeared: WebAssembly.
WebAssembly is a format that is much closer to the language that programs like Go are compiled into.
As such, we see more and more compilers over time that are able to compile code into WebAssembly.

Globally speaking we have 4 ways to get [fzf-lib](https://github.com/reinhrst/fzf-lib) to work in our browser:
- Automatically convert the Go code into JavaScript code
- Manually rewrite the Go code to (something that produces) JavaScript code
- Automatically covert the Go code to WebAssembly
- Manually rewrite the Go code to (something that produces) WebAssembly

<div markdown="1" class="notice">
Two remarks should be made about this list:

It should be noted first of all that although people do write JavaScript directly, larger projects tend to be written in other languages (such as TypeScript) which easily convert to JavaScript. The difference between compiling Go code to JavaScript and compiling something like TypeScript to JavaScript is that the latter is a much easier process. typeScript can be thought of as syntactic sugar on top as JavaScript; it for instance uses the same APIs and data structures. Therefore it's more likely that a TypeScript -> JavaScript compiler will produce (close to) optimal code, than a Go -> JavaScript compiler.

WebAssembly is another story.
WebAssembly is not human-friendly, and there are probably very few people programming WebAssembly by hand.
The reason why it may be more efficient to re-write the code into another language, and then compile to to WebAssembly, is that some compilers are more mature than others, some languages will allow more control over what WebAssembly is produced.

Secondly, there is a fifth option that should be described for completeness sake.
In order to get fzf like behaviour in a browser, the browser could make use of a backend.
In this case it would send the list of items to search in to the backend (a web address) together with a search query, and get the results back.
The backend could run any language (including Go), and even make use of the commandline fzf program.
There are however large disadvantages to this option:
- It would require someone to build (and pay for) a backend server to do this work
- It would send large lists of data to search in over the internet, resulting in relatively large delays
- There may be privacy/security implications related to sending all this data to another server (unless you run your own server).
</div>

In this post I will look at the viability of all four options, and look at the preformance of them, as well as things like code size, ease of use, stability, etc.
It should be kept in mind that I'm only testing one specific program.
In addition, the different methods that I'm testing were not all developed for the exact purpose that I have in mind.
In no way should this post be considered a definite answer to the question which method or project is "better".
At the same time, when I started out on this problem, I could not find *any* information on what methods were available, and what would be the upsides and downsides of all of them.

# The projects to test

We will be looking at four methods/projects.
Two of these are compilers from Go to WebAssembly; one is a compiler from Go to JavaScript.
As I was about to test these, I started to get interested in how these methods would perform against a version that was written directly in JavaScript; just as I was about to start work on that, I ran into [fzf-for-js][3], a project started literally a week after I has searched the whole Internet for just that :).
Fzf-for-js's author managed to rewrite fzf in TypeScript, trying to stay as close to the original Go code as possible.

This means that (for now) we cover 3 of the 4 categories to get Go programs to run in the browser.
It might be interesting to also have an WebAssembly optimised version (for instance, written in C, compiled to WebAssembly), although it remains to be seen what kind of extra speedup such a version would give us.

<div markdown="1" class="notice">
It's important to have a small side-panel on WebAssembly.
"Traditional wisdom" is that compiled programs run many times faster than interpreted programs.
Therefore it's tempting to assume that if you want something to be fast, you should look at WebAssembly.
There are blogposts out there trying to determine how much faster WebAssembly is; then there are plenty of blogs saying that these other blogs do it wrong, and don't get realistic results (mostly because they take trivial programs in tight loops, which is almost never what you encounter in real cyberlife).
Just a couple of months ago, a Surma, a Web Advocate at Google, did some tests and wrote a [very interesting article][4] on this subject.

A long read, but the first 2 lines say it all:

> Add WebAssembly, get performance. Is that how it really works?
> The incredibly unsatisfying answer is: It depends. It depends on oh-so-many factors, and Iâ€™ll be touching on some of them here.
</div>


## Go WebAssembly target
The standard Go compiler (we use Go version 1.16 here, the newest at the time of writing) can generate WebAssembly code, using `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm`.
Whereas Go is by now a mature language, powering products such as Docker and Kubernetes, the WebAssembly target feels a bit inmature as of yet.
While trying to get this all to work, in ran into a lot of small issues that did not seem to be documented anywhere.
[This page](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly) describes WebAssembly in Go.

## TinyGo WebAssembly target
[Tinygo](https://tinygo.org) is meant to compile Go for embedded devices (where space considerations are more important) and WebAssembly.
Whereas the Go WebAssembly target for fzf-lib is around 2.5MB (this is uncompressed; WebAssembly code can be compressed to about 25% size for more efficient transfer), Tinygo produces files that are between 0.5 and 1MB in size (depending on what compile options are chosen).

The price for this reduction in size, is that not all Go library functionality is supported (in fzf-lib there is one function, runtime.NumCPU(), which is not supported in Tinygo at the moment).
I also ran into some differences between Go and Tinygo when converting between `int64` and `int`, but I'm not 100% sure that wasn't just my fault.
All in all it's amazing that the Tinygo developers manage to compile to a WebAssembly that is about 30% of the size of the one that Go produces.

TinyGo WebAssembly target also does not give me the feeling of a mature implementation.
For instance, compiling fzf-lib with default options leads to a very cryptic error message;
searching on this message showed [this issue](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues/1790) which has been open for almost 4 months now.
Again, I think the Tinygo developers do amazing work, however I do feel that some more work has to be done for this to become a stable feature.

It should be noted that TinyGo has compile-flags that allow one to set an optimisation level, and a garbage collector.
Those that have managed to work their way through [Surma's article][4] that I mentioned before, will remember that garbage collection can have a huge influence on performance.
[Available values](https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/usage/important-options/) for `-opt` are `0`, `1`, `2`, `s` and `z` (the default).
`0`, `1` and `2` here mean more optimisation, while `s` and `z` are supposed to mean "optimisation like `2`, but while reducing output size".
In my tests, `2` and `s` give exactly the same output, and `z` gives the error mentioned above; for that reason, I compiled with `2` for this test (where necessary, a quick mention is made of the differences between different optimisations).

There are 2 garbage collection strategies that can be used; the standard one (called `conservative`), and `leaking`, which means that never any garbagecollection is done.
Where possible I test both, although it should be very clear that `leaking` should only be used in production after very conserate thought and testing, since it's asking for your webpage being killed because of out-of-memory problems.

## GopherJS
GopherJS is a compiler from Go to Javascript (rather than WebAssembly).
As mentioned on its [github page](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs), *[i]ts main purpose is to give you the opportunity to write front-end code in Go which will still run in all browsers.*

It is in active development, up to date (supports Go 1.16), and has been around for a while (first commits are in 2013), much longer than that Go and Tinygo has WASM compile targets.
The description however shows that the main goal is not necessarily performance, so it will be interesting to see how it performs.

## Fzf-for-js
Just 2 months ago, an effort was started to create a JavaScript (TypeScript) clone of fzf: [fzf-for-js][3].
The author first tried the GopherJS approach to compile directly to JavaScript, however found out that the Gopher generated code was 27k lines.
He therefore decided to "transcribe" the go code to TypeScript himself.
At this point most of the actual fzf searching (including fzf algorthm v2) is implemented.
Caching is not yet implemented at the time of writing; this should not influence our first round of performance tests, since we will actively avoid tests that can be cached.
It does mean that at this time it may not be usable yet for production use, however considering the speed with which development has progressed over the past few months, I would expect caching to be implemented soon.

Fzf-lib, which is the basis for the go compilers, has a slight extension over standard fzf, namely that it returns both the *score* of a hit, as well as the exact *positions* in the input string that the hit was made on.
Fzf-for-js returns at this moment only the *score*.
In order to come to a clean comparison, I will patch fzf-for-js so that it also returns the positions.


# Testing
I have thought for a long time on what would be the best, and fairest, way to compare the methods.
Even if all we care about is performance, it's unclear what performance is actually the most interesting, especially when considering this post is hoping to be useful beyond fzf-lib, for other go libraries.

## Considerations

### Which flow to test
First one has to decide what "flow" to test.
In this case, I generated 524288 (<katex-inline>2^{19}</katex-inline>) random lines of text (see repo for code, TODO).
In these lines, we fzf-search for the string "hello world" (the full operation is similar to `cat lines_524288.txt | fzf --filter "hello world"`).
We time how long it takes to load lines into fzf, and then how long it takes from the search command, until we have our result back.

There may certainly be other intersting things to measure; for instance, how long does a second search for the same string ("hello world") take.
Or, try a more realistic scenario where someone is typing into the search box and we want to show live results.
In this case we would search first for "h", then "he", then "hel", etc, until we get to "hello world".

TODO: write something on whether we also tested other flows, and if the results are the same.

### Test start and endpoint
A full run will start with loading the javascript and the lines to search in into the javascript process.
For the WebAssembly based systems, the `.wasm` also has to be loaded and setup in the javascript engine.

TODO: will later show test start and endpoints

In certain cases it may make sense to run the test in such a way that the start point and endpoint are in WebAssembly.

### Test runs / warm up time
Modern day JavaScript runs as a sort of multi-stage rocket (for an in-depth article about the trade-offs, see [here](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/prototypes#tradeoffs)).
When JavaScript is run the first time, it's done so in a relatively slow interpreter.
As soon as the system notices that a certain bit of JavaScript is run more often, this part is sent off to a compiler.
The compiler actually makes the system a bit slower *while compiling*, but as soon as it's done, that part of JavaScript is now orders of magnitude faster.
In modern JavaScript engines, there may be even another stage, when even more compiling happens, and the code is even faster at the end.

Usually when I read articles comparing JavaScript to WebAssembly, the speed is compared only after a couple of runs.
This means that all code has been compiled by that time.

What the more usable metric is, is debatable.
A single-page web-app may be ok with a small slowdown at the start, whereas in some other cases every millisecond may count.
I will not allow javascript to warm-up / compile before the start of the main tests, however I will look at how much difference it would make if I did allow warm up.

### Where to run the tests
Both JavaScript and WebAssembly are being run within a JavaScript engine.
There are at least three major JavaScript engines out there (more depending on where you draw the line of what is "major").
Google Chrome and Node (and Microsoft Edge) run [v8][5].
Firefox runs [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey), and Safari runs [JavaScriptCore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit#JavaScriptCore).
There are stand-alone versions of these engines (which can be installed through [jsvu](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsvu), which should make testing a lot easier.

TODO: where do we actually test.

### Versions to test
In order to make the tests not more complicated than necessary, I tested with the latest stable versions of all browsers, Node, Go, TinyGo and Gopher.
Considering the speed of development of fzf-for-js, I tested the latest dev version of this.

### Hardware to test on
All tests were done on a MacBook M1. All code ran in darwin-arm64/Apple Silicon mode; Rosetta was not used.

## Preparations
We decided to do a proper end-to-end test, where the data, where we start with the data to search in (the Hay) and the data to search for (the Needle) in JavaScript, and want our result back in JavaScript.
Since 3 of the 4 projects we're looking at, are automatic compilations from Go, we need to create an interface so that our JavaScript can talk to our Go code (which will be either WebAssembly or JavaScript itself).

TODO: damn this is a post by itself!

What would be a good thing to measure:
- init time
- search time (first time)
- search time (after a number of loops, without cache)
- incremental search time (with cache)

- Max search time (see tiny_wasm_slow)


We do the following:
- Start browser with http://localhost:8000/mypage.html?itemcount=....
- This loads the page, the javascipt and (if applicable) the wasm
- It loads haystack_#itemcount#
- settle() (sleep)
- logts
- init fzf with the haystack
- repeat 10 times:
    - logts
    - search "hello world"
    - logts
    - search "quick sting"
    - logts
    - search "walks weird"
    - logts
- make call to http://localhost:8000/log.html?test=safari,gopherjs,1024,ts1,ts2,.... (or print this data)


Running on the pure javascript engines would take more work; golang wasm file expects some polyfills which are not available
