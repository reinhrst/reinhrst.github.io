## Use
This website collects data (directly and indirectly) for 3 uses:
 
### Analysing use of the website
The author(s) of the website writes the stories and maintains the site on a purely voluntary basis, in their free time.
No money is received either directly or indirectly (except via a “donate” button asking for voluntary donations, planned in the future).
Part of the satisfaction that writing for this site gives, is knowing that people actually read (and hopefully enjoy) the posts on this site.
For this reason, data is collected to analyse the use of the website.

In addition to “getting a sense of purpose” by seeing how many people read this site, the analytical data may be used to decide which posts are popular (and hence whih subjects deserve further posts).

Analytics are collected through Google Analytics.
In according with the manual of the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens in The Netherland, Google Analytics has been set up in a way that collects the bare minimum of data.

Google Analytics uses cookies in order to generate the analytics.
This cookie is a small text file with a unique identifier that is saved on your computer.
Since these cookies are use exclusively for legitimate interest, and therefore no permission has to be asked under EU law (GDPR) for their use.

The following settings were chosen for Google Analytics:
- There is a processing agreement for processing of personal data between the owner of this website, and Google
- IP addresses are “anonymised” by removing the last 8 bits.
- No data is shared with Google, other than to provide the Analytics service
- No data is shared with Google for advertisement
